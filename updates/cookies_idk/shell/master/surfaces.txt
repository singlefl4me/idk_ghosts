//These collisions are appended to surfaces 0 through 25, except surface10 because that's the default Kero surface (which this shell isn't using)

	//The only collision that is strictly mandatory for FLELE compatibility is the one labelled 'menu'. All the others are optional, but you can add them if you like.
	//menu == main menu (Any areas of the shell that do NOT have a hotspot will also act as the main menu in FLUX. In FLELE, ONLY this hotspot will let the user access the main menu.)
	
	//These ones are standard for most FLELE shells:
	//stroke_p == pettable area
	//play_button == play song, next song if already playing music, resume if a song is paused
	//stop_button1 or stop_button2 == stop song
	//k_window == music panel (music bar in FLELE)
	//clear_button == Clear the playlist
	
	//These are additional ones that you can use if you like:
	//minimize == minimizes the ghost
	//end_sect == closes the ghost
	
	//And these four you can use if you want, but they will not work with FLELE!
	//next_button == next song
	//previous_button == previous song
	//pause_button == pause/resume button
	//stop_after_current == sets the music to stop after the current song finishes playing
