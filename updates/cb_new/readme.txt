Cookie Band for FLUX

A flux shell that lets you put up to 12(!!) Cookie Run characters on your desktop to play music. Multiple characters have instuments you can enable through the menu.
Due to how the ghost is set up currently, instruments should only be enabled after the song starts playing. When reloading/starting up, the characters may take a minute to show if you have any enabled beforehand.

Hotspots (shining glitter cookie):
