A simple virtual pet styled after the game Bugsnax. It'll be able to walk around your desktop and you can interact with it. It may need to get comfortable with you first before you do so. Sauces will appear on your desktop occasionally and can be given to your snak.

(personal note 2/23/23: this ghost is based on a concept I had held on to for almost 2 years. i lost interest in making a pervious version of this ghost, and recently decided on doing this one as a revamp. this version is one i'm much happier with overall.)
Features may be added/changed in the future. Thanks for downloading!
